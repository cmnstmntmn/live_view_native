## About

LiveView Native is a platform for building native applications using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view). It allows a single LiveView to serve both web and non-web clients by transforming platform-specific template code into native UIs:

```elixir
# lib/my_app_web/live/hello_live.ex
defmodule MyAppWeb.HelloLive do
  use MyAppWeb, :live_view
  use MyAppNative, :live_view
end

# liv/my_app_web/live/hello_live_swiftui.ex
def MyAppWeb.HelloLive.SwiftUI do
  use MyAppNative, [:render_component, format: :swiftui]

  def render(assigns, %{"target" => "watchos"}) do
    ~LVN"""
    <VStack>
      <Text>
        Hello WatchOS!
      </Text>
    </VStack>
    """
  end

  def render(assigns, _interface) do
    ~LVN"""
    <VStack>
      <Text>
        Hello SwiftUI!
      </Text>
    </VStack>
    """
  end
end
```

## Getting started

In addition to `live_view_native` you may want to include some additional libraries:

```elixir
{:live_view_native, "~> 0.3.0-rc.1"},
{:live_view_native_stylesheet, "~> 0.3.0-rc.1"},
{:live_view_native_swiftui, "~> 0.3.0-rc.1"},
{:live_view_native_stylesheet, "~> 0.3.0-rc.1"}
```

Then add the client plugin to `config/config.exs`

```
config :live_view_native, plugins: [
  LiveViewNative.SwiftUI
]
```

then run:

```
$ mix lvn.setup
```

This task will several other tasks that will generate multiple files into your project.
A list of changes to several files in your Phoenix app will be printed after the task
completes. Please make sure to complete all of the `Required` changes otherwise LiveView Native
will not run properly.
